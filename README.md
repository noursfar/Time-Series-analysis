# Time-Series-analysis
Analyzing the UK's economic policy impacts on growth using Vector Autoregression (VAR). This project models relationships between growth, monetary mass, inflation, and public spending from 1972-2022.

## Project Overview

The project explores the dynamic relationships between economic growth, monetary mass, inflation, and public spending in the UK using Vector Autoregression (VAR) models. The analysis aims to understand how these variables interact over time and influence the UK's economic growth, providing insights that can inform policy decisions.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Compilation of time series data from various sources for key economic indicators from 1972 to 2022.
- **VAR Modeling**: Implementation of Vector Autoregression models to analyze the interactions between multiple economic variables.
- **Causality Tests**: Execution of Granger causality tests to explore the direction and nature of relationships between variables.
- **Impulse Response Functions**: Analysis of how economic shocks to one variable affect others over time.
- **Variance Decomposition**: Examination of the contribution of each economic shock to the forecast error variances of each variable in the model.

## Objectives

- To model the impact of economic policies on growth using VAR.
- To assess the interdependencies between economic variables over time.
- To provide empirical evidence that supports or refutes theoretical economic assumptions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Used for statistical modeling and forecasting.
- **EViews**: Employed for advanced econometric analysis, specifically for VAR modeling and diagnostics.

## Repository Contents

- **Data**: Folder containing cleaned and pre-processed time series data.
- **Scripts**: Python and EViews scripts used for VAR modeling and analysis.
- **Analysis Results**: Includes impulse response functions, causality test results, and variance decomposition.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive report detailing the methodology, analysis, and conclusions.
